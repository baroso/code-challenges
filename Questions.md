#Java Developer Questions

####Java Questions
    - Which java version do you use daily? (should use Java 8)
    - Do you know Java 8 Features (should know: "Lambdas", "Optionals", "Streams")
    - What is difference between JDK,JRE and JVM? (should answer: JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine, it is an abstract machine which provides the runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform dependent). JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.)
    - What is Inheritance? (should answer: Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of another object of another class. It represents IS-A relationship. It is used for Code Resusability and Method Overriding.)
    - Is it possible to instantiate the abstract class? (should answer: No, abstract class can never be instantiated.)
    - Can you declare an interface method static? (should answer: No, because methods of an interface is abstract by default, and static and abstract keywords can't be used together.)
    - What are wrapper classes? (should answer: Wrapper classes are classes that allow primitive types to be accessed as objects.)
    - What is singleton class? (should answer: Singleton class means that any given time only one instance of the class is present, in one JVM.)
    - What design patterns do you know? (should answer at least: Singleton, Prototype, Builder, Decorator, Factory, Observer)

####Spring Questions
    - Which spring framework modules do you know? (should answer at least: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA)
    - What spring module to use to insert rows to MySQL Database (should answer: Spring Data JPA)
    - What spring module to use to send a message to RabbitMQ (should answer: Spring AMQP)
    - What is the difference between annotations @Controller and @RestController (should answer: The key difference between a traditional @Controller and the @RestController is the way the HTTP response body is created.)
